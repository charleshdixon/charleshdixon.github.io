            <p>I'm Charles. This is my first ever GitHub Pages site. Hope you have a pleasant stay!</p>
            <ul>
            <p>This is a webpage testing site to familiarze myself with HTML, as well as the fundamentals of Jekyll down the road.
            Such is the ongoing experiment. I can already see the form of much of the text-based webpages
            I encounter on the daily. We shall see (...) how it goes for me!
